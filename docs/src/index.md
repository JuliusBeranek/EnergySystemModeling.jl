# Energy System Modeling
Mathematical reference for the energy system model. The model presented here is based on the model in [^1]. We express units using square brackets.

## Utility
We calculate annualized costs using [*equivalent annual cost (EAC)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_annual_cost) formula

$$EAC(c,r,n) = \frac{c}{a_{n,r}},\quad a_{n,r} = \frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r},\quad a_{n,0}=n,$$

where $c$ is the net present cost of the project, $n$ is the number of payments, and $r$ is the interest rate.

## Indices and Sets
Indices and sets define the different objects and dimensions in the model.

*  $g∈G$: Generation technologies
*  $G^r⊆G$: Renewable generation technologies

*  $l∈L$: Transmission lines, bidimensional vectors $(i,j)$ where $i,j∈N$

## Instance
Users can provide input parameters for different instances as a directory containing CSV and JSON files, and also include a README file, which describes the instance. Users can distribute instances as `.zip` archives. We recommend checking out the example instance in `examples/instance` for reference. We describe the input format in [`Params(::AbstractString)`](@ref). Output can be save into JSON using [`save_json`](@ref).
